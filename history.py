    Romansh is a romance language spoken in grisons, in Switzerland.
    
    It's creation story is pretty much the same as all other romance languages: There are some celtic tribes, then the romans came and introduced Latin. After the roman empire falls, the germanic tribes come and the languages mix together to form new languages.
    Unlike other romance languages, the Rhaeto-romance languages (of which Romansh is one) are distinct from other languages because of isolation due to geographical features and exposure to other languages.""")
with tab2:
    st.markdown("""Despite less than 1% of Switzerlamd speaking Romansh, it is still a national language. But why?

There are a few things, however the main factor was that in the lead up to the 2nd world war, Hitler was saying that he wanted to get all the German speaking countries back together. The swiss people were (unsurprisingly) not very keen on this idea. To try and diffrentiate themselves from Germany, in 1938, Romansh became a national language.""")

    st.markdown("""Rumantsch Grischun (RG) is the standard form of Romansh, used in most media, and signs. It was made in 1982 to standardise the language, however apart from aforementioned uses, everybody sticks to their own dialects. These are:

    â€¢ Sursilvan
    â€¢ Sutsilvan
    â€¢ Surmiran
    â€¢ Puter
    â€¢ Vallader""")
